# Lab: Using variables, arrays, and hash tables in PowerShell

## Scenario

You're preparing to create scripts to automate server administration in your organization. Before you begin, you want to practice working with variables, arrays, and hash tables.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Work with variable types.
- Use arrays.
- Use hash tables.

## Estimated time: 45 minutes

## Lab setup

Virtual machines: **AZ-040T00A-LON-DC1**, **AZ-040T00A-LON-SVR1**, and **AZ-040T00A-LON-CL1**

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you'll use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, complete the following steps:

1. Open **LON-DC1** and sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Repeat step 1 for **LON-SVR1** and **LON-CL1**.

## Exercise 1: Working with variable types

### Exercise scenario 1

You first plan to practice working with different types of variables.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Use string variables.
1. Use DateTime variables.

### Task 1: Use string variables

1. On **LON-CL1**, open Windows PowerShell.
1. Create a variable `$logPath` that contains **C:\logs**\.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Help about_Variables -ShowWindow
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logPath = "C:\Logs\"
    ```
    </Strong></details> 

3. For `$logPath`, identify the type of variable and the available properties and methods.
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logPath | Get-Member
    ```
    </Strong></details> 

4. Create a variable `$logFile` that contains **log.txt**.
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logFile = "log.txt"
    ```
    </Strong></details> 

5. Update `$logPath` to include the contents of `$logFile`.
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logPath = $logPath + $logFile
    # Or you could write this in a shorthand version:
    # $logPath += $logFile
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see an advanced answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logPath = $logPath.TrimEnd('\') + '\' + $logFile
    # This solution provides a way to fix the proble of not including a '\' backslash 
    # when defining the original $LogPath, for example:
    # $LogPath = "C:\Logs"
    ```
    </Strong></details> 

6. Update the path stored in `$logPath` to use drive **D** instead of drive **C**.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    $logPath | Get-Member
    # look for methods that will help
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logPath.Replace("C:","D:")
    # The ':' is included here so that the C: will be replaced with D:
    # If $logPath.Replace("C","D") was used this would replace every 
    # occurrence of C with D not just at the start.
    ```
    </Strong></details> 

7. Verify the variable has been modified.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Command *Date*
    # look for a command that will get the current date
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
     $logPath
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
8. Leave the PowerShell window open 

### Task 2: Use DateTime variables

1. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, create a variable `$today` that contains todayâ€™s date.
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $today = Get-Date
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
2. For the variable `$today`, identify the type of variable and the available properties and methods.
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $today | Get-Member
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
3. Use the properties of `$today` to create a string in the format **Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute.txt**, and store the value in `$logFile`.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    # When adding objects together the first object type (left most object) 
    # is what all of the other objects are converted to, if possible.
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $logFile = "" + $today.Year + "-" + $today.Month + "-" + $today.Day + "-" + $today.Hour + "-" + $today.Minute + ".txt"
    # OR 
    # $logFile = [string]$today.Year + "-" + $today.Month + "-" + $today.Day + "-" + $today.Hour + "-" + $today.Minute + ".txt"
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
4. Create a variable `$cutOffDay` that contains the date **30** days before today.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    $today | Get-Member
    # Check for methods that would help
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    $cutOffDate = $today.AddDays(-30)
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
5. Use **Get-ADUser** to query user accounts that have signed in since `$cutOffDay`. Filter by using the **LastLogonDate** property.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | Get-Member
    # The -Properties parameter is required as ActiveDirectory PowerShell cmdlets only return 
    # a very limited number of properties (this is very different to most other PS cmdlets)
    #
    # look for a property that would show that last time a logon occurred
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
    <details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary><Strong> 
    
    ```PowerShell
    Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties LastLogonDate | Where-Object {$_.LastLogonDate -gt $cutOffDate}
    ```
    </Strong></details> 
6. Leave the Windows PowerShell prompt open for the next exercise.

## Exercise 2: Using arrays

### Exercise scenario 2

Now that you've practiced using different types of variables, you want to work with arrays.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Use an array to update the department for users.
1. Use an array list.

### Task 1: Use an array to update the department for users

1. Query all Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) users in the **Marketing** department and place them in a variable named `$mktgUsers`. Include the **Department** property in the results.
    <details><summary>Click for hint</summary><Strong> 

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Help Get-ADUser -ShowWindow

## Exercise 3: Using hash tables

### Exercise scenario 3

After using variables and arrays, you plan to practice working with hash tables. You want to learn how working with hash tables differs from arrays and array lists.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Use a hash table.

### Task 1: Use a hash table

1. Create a hash table named `$mailList` with the following users and email addresses:

   - User **Frank** with the email address **Frank@fabrikam.com**
   - User **Libby** with the email address **LHayward@contoso.com**
   - User **Matej** with the email address **MStojanov@tailspintoys.com**

    # @{
    #    Name1 = 'Value'
    #    Name2 = 'Value'
    # }
    #
    # Hashtables must have unique key names

      Frank="Frank@fabriakm.com"
      Libby="LHayward@contso.com"
      Matej="MSTaojanov@tailspintoys.com"
    }
    # The difference is this creates an ordered set of values, whereas the previous may be reordered by PowerShell 
    ```
